# Some information about GritUI

## What is GritUI?

GritUI is designed for an iOS app called Codea, you can learn about it on [Codea Official Website](https://codea.io).

To solve the problem that I can't create a button, a slider or a switch directly, I created GritUI. It includes a slider, a switch, a pop-up window and something else.

You can just use them like this:
```lua
  addNewPopAlert("Hello!","Welcome!",true,5)
```
and you have finished.

## Can I use it now?

You can see how to use it in `wiki.md`.
