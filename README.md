# Some information about GritUI

## What is GritUI?

GritUI is designed for an iOS app called Codea, you can learn about it on [Codea Official Website](https://codea.io).

To solve the problem that I can't create a button, a slider or a switch directly, I created GritUI. It includes a slider, a switch, a pop-up window and something else.

You can just use them like this:

  addNewPopAlert("Hello!","Welcome!",true,5)

and you have finished.

## Can I use it now?

**Actucally No.**

I have given up the update of GritUI as a result of some personal things. And the code is just for study or, even just for leaving a memorial.
**But if you want to use it, you can email me and maybe I will help you run the code.**
