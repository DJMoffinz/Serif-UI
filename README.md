# Serif
Serif is a UI library for the iOS app [Codea](https://codea.io). It builds on SoulWINTER's [GritUI](https://github.com/soulwinter/GritUI) project, but with an overhauled appearance, and geared towards game development.

Serif won't be ready for use for a while, so in the meantime go show GritUI some love. SoulWINTER isn't maintaining it anymore, but I plan to add some language localization and a few bug fixes/QoL features to it, too.

## License
No license file was included in the original project this fork is derived from,
but when I contacted SoulWINTER to ask for permission to create this fork, they confirmed
it can be used as though it were under the [MIT license](LICENSE), which I have continued to use for Serif.
